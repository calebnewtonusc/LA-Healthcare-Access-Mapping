Presenter: *shows static chart*
Audience: "What does this mean for MY neighborhood?"
Result: Limited engagement, no clear next steps
```

#### AFTER
```
Presenter: "Red areas on this map are healthcare deserts"
           *shows interactive heat map on screen*
Audience: "Oh, that's my neighborhood!"
Presenter: "Good news - mobile clinics can be here in 3 months"
           *shows plain-language community report*
Presenter: "Here's how to contact your supervisor" *action steps*
Result: Empowered community, clear actions, grassroots support
```

### Scenario: Grant Application

#### BEFORE
```
Application: "We need funding for healthcare improvements"
Budget: "Estimated cost: Medium-High"
Impact: "Will improve access for underserved populations"

Funder: "How much exactly? What's the ROI?"
You: "Um, we don't have exact numbers..."
Result: Application rejected (too vague)
```

#### AFTER
```
Application: "We need $1.25M for 5 mobile health clinics"
Budget: "One-time: $1.25M, Annual: $2M"
Impact: "Serves 4,805 residents, 0.76:1 benefit-cost ratio"
ROI: "Negative ROI (does not break even), essential access service"

Result: Tabled for "more information"
```

#### AFTER
```
You: "I'll show you 10 specific locations" *interactive map*
     "This costs $645M but saves $4.1B" *cost-benefit analysis*
     "Transportation program pays back immediately" *ROI data*
Board: "Wow, these visualizations are clear"
Board: "540% ROI? That's excellent"
Board: "Let's move forward with the transportation program first"
